Philosophy
----------

The tiscamera is an open source project published under the Apache 2.0 license.
This means that user can integrate the project or parts of it into their projects
without hassle. Modifications or maintenance can be done without assistance of The Imaging Source.
This allows for extended product life cycles.

The fact that the entire software stack is open allows the usage of arbitrary hardware.
The only requirement is a Linux based operating system.
