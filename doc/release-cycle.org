* Things that have to work before releasing

** tiscamera

*** check if all cameras are found

tcam-ctrl -l

*** check if all required formats are supported by the backends

These currently exclude by12, by16

tcam-ctrl -c <SERIAL>

*** get usb3 color cameras and run these pipelines:

gst-launch-1.0 tcambin ! videoconvert ! ximagesink
gst-launch-1.0 tcambin ! bayer2rgb ! videoconvert ! ximagesink
gst-launch-1.0 tcambin ! video/x-raw,format=RGBx ! videoconvert ! ximagesink

!!! _if the camera has native rgb/yuv test those to ensure they are passed and not emulated_ !!!
e.g.
gst-launch-1.0 tcambin ! video/x-raw,format=BGR ! videoconvert ! ximagesink
